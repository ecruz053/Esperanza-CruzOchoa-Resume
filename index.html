        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">In regards to my major, I want to obtain a bachelorâ€™s degree in psychology then further my to become a school counselor. I want to pursue this career because it enables me to assist people and provides me the opportunity to improve the mental health of my future patients; ultimately allowing me to improve their quality of life. In the future, I want to come back to the Coachella Valley area to help the residents. By visiting the valley frequently I hope to gain the trust of the residents and improve their mental and health issues. In general, I will serve as a therapist who they can talk to and receive advice from. I also want to visit schools to make a change in the school environment since I recognize several students suffer from substance abuse; I want to help minimize some of the numbers. I will not only approach students as an adult who has a degree but as a friend who grew up in the same place as them. All in all, with higher education I will be able to obtain a reliable career that allows me to give back to my community. Therefore supporting any expenses I want to create and finance for my community To elaborate, I want to have a bonfire event, dinner potluck, fun gatherings that will consist of food and games, and more entertainments. All of which I hope become traditions in the community.
<br><br>Being raised by Mexican parents has allowed me to understand the importance of helping others. Now I enjoy volunteering as a translator at my high school and local elementary school. This activity is delightful because I can help parents and students while connecting with the Hispanic culture. Serving as an interpreter has made me comprehend the significance of being bilingual and how vital it is to express my voice. By translating to community members I help promote a welcoming environment through which people can communicate. Lastly, Iâ€™m currently working as a tutor for elementary kids and it has reinforced the abundance of support students need whether that be emotionally or academically. 
<br><br>Through interpreting and tutoring Iâ€™ve been able to help several individuals. When speaking to adults and children, I realize how each person deals with their problems and even how a parent's conflicts affect students' performance. This made me realize that I want to study psychology to become a counselor. As a school counselor I'm able to aid students succeed while assisting parents. My community service has inspired this because school is where I can equally interact with both adolescents and adults. By being a counselor, I can also serve as a translator and encourage first-generation students - like me - to continue with their education. Overall, I want to encourage minorities to pursue their dreams. By majoring in psychology I will be able to help students understand their conflicts and give them advice. I seek to be a guidance counselor to improve the chances of a student's success. I want to be their support system.
<br><br>Moving forward with my life I want to continue helping underprivileged students in reaching their goals because I was one of those students. Thankfully I had people who were able to assist me when I needed answers about college, scholarships, or how to research careers.
